= Requirements =
  # Installed Linux distributions (other platform may also be supported, or not, your mileage may vary).
  # The plcbus deamon server, it will be hosted on Google Code in the near future, but for now it can be downloaded [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11711990/Serial/plcbus.pl here]
  # Required Module originally written by Ron Frazer: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11711990/Serial/IOSelectBuffered.pm IOSelectBurrered.pm]

= Installation =
  # Save plcbus.pl into an executable directory (I use /usr/local/bin) and make it executable.
  # Modify $serdev on line 11 of plcbus.pl to match your system (i.e. /dev/ttyUSB0). I use a custom udev rule to ensure my device is always /dev/plcbus.
  # Save IOSelectBurrered.pm into a directory called SerialLibs (note the use of uppercase letters) in one of the standard perl module locations (I use /etc/perl/SerialLibs).
  # Run the server in the background:
  {{{plcbus.pl &}}}

= Usage =
  * Send commands from any network connect pc using netcat in the following format:

  {{{echo -e 'a1,preset_dim,64,5\nEXIT\n' | nc -i 1 localhost 5151}}}

  where:
  * _a1_ can be replaced with the appropriate plcbus device
  *_preset_dim can be replaced with the appropriate command or query (see lines 18 to 46 of plcbus.pl for a complete list)
  * _64_ can be replaced with an appropriate value (in hex) for the command (ignored if not relevant)
  * _5_ can be replaced with an appropriate value (in hex) for the command (ignored if not relevant)
  * _localhost_ can be replaced by the appropriate hostname or ip address that the server resides upon
  * _-i 1_ is only required if you are sending commands from a remote computer and don't seem to be getting a response

  Note that for some Linux installation, 'nc' has to replaced with 'netcat'

  The example code above turns device a1 (a dimmable light module) on to full brightness (hex 64 = 100) over a period of 5 seconds. The response given is:

  {{{PRESET_DIM,100,5}}}

  ...which tells you that the dim level is 100% and the execution time was 5 seconds.
