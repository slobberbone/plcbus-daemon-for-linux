= Requirements =
  # Installed Linux distribution (other platforms may also be supported, or not, your mileage may vary).
  # The plcbus deamon server.
  # IOSelectBuffered.pm - Perl Module originally written by Ron Frazer.
  # PLCBUS-1141 or PLCBUS-1141+ PLCBUS Computer Interface (USB or RS-232).

= Installation =
  # Download the latest tarball from [http://plcbus-daemon-for-linux.googlecode.com/files/plcbus.pl here] and extract the files.
  # Save plcbus.pl into an executable directory (I use /usr/local/bin) and make it executable.
  # Save IOSelectBurrered.pm into a directory called SerialLibs (note the use of uppercase letters) in one of the standard perl module locations (I use /etc/perl/SerialLibs).
  # Run the server help page to see the default settings and available options:
  {{{plcbus.pl --help}}}
  # Run the server in the background with the appropriate settings if required:
  {{{plcbus.pl --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 &}}}

= Usage =
  * Interact with the controller from any network connect pc using netcat in the following manner:
  
  {{{nc localhost 5151}}}  Change localhost and 5151 to the appropriate hostname (or IP address) and port accordingly.
  
  Note that for some Linux installation, 'nc' has to replaced with 'netcat'.  To exit the session, simply type {{{exit}}}
  
  Commands can be issued to the 1141 in the following format:

  {{{a1,preset_dim,64,5}}}

  where:
  * _a1_ can be replaced with the appropriate plcbus device
  *_preset_dim can be replaced with the appropriate command or query (see the output of {{{plcbus.pl --info}}} for a complete list)
  * _64_ can be replaced with a decimal value from 0 to 100 for the command (ignored if not relevant)
  * _5_ can be replaced with a decimal value from 0 to 100 for the command (ignored if not relevant)

  Note that for some Linux installation, 'nc' has to replaced with 'netcat'

  The example code above turns device a1 (a dimmable light module) on to 64% brightness over a period of 5 seconds. The response given is:

  {{{A1,PRESET_DIM,64,5}}}

  ...which tells you that the dim level is 64% and the execution time was 5 seconds.
  
  Commands can be sent from scripts easily by piping the output of echo to netcat.  For the above example:
  
  {{{echo -e 'a1,preset_dim,64,5\nEXIT\n' | nc localhost 5151}}}
  
  ...would achieve the same result.  If you are using a slow connection use the -i netcat option to increase the interval:
  
  {{{echo -e 'a1,preset_dim,64,5\nEXIT\n' | nc -i 1 othernetworkhost 5151}}}
